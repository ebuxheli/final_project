## Russian Trolls in the 2016 US Election

This project is an analysis of nearly 3 million tweets associated with the Internet Research Agency, a known Russian agency tasked with interfering in US politics. 

Tweets analyzed here are relevant for the timeframe surrounding the 2016 US Presidential Election. I took a closer look at nearly 3 million tweets that twitter deemed to be associated with the Internet Research Agency, a known Russian agency that has been tasked with interfering in US politics. I was looking at tweets in the timeframe surrounding the 2016 election to see trends in activity by varying historical events determined by when trump first declared his candidacy until a year after he was elected. An example of some of the events I was looking for were when fake news was first tweeted out by President  Trump in January 2017, we see a resulting bump in tweets containing “fake news” by Russian trolls. 

Here I've provided background information which I feel is necessary to understand the analysis I have run:
* "Fake News" - a phrase first used by President Trump on Twitter in January 2017 to propagate disinformation and distrust
