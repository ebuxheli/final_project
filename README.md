## GOV 1005: Data
### Russian Trolls in the 2016 US Election

The scope of this project will be to analyze close to 3 million tweets that are associated with the Internet Research Agency which is a known Russian agency that has been tasked with interfering in US politics. 

I will be taking a closer look at tweets in the timeframe surrounding the 2016 election to see trends in tweet activity by varying types of accounts by this agency. For example, looking at right trolls - charged with creating disinformation to promote the election of Trump - and left trolls - charged with dividing the Democratic party between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton and creating a general sense of distrust within the party - to see if they had an impactful effect on this election.
