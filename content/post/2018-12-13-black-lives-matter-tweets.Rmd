After my analysis of daily Internet Research Agency (IRA) tweets and some of Trump's more popular
phrases, I felt that it was imperative to take a look at the mentions of the "Black Lives Matter"
movement. This is because of the prominence of events that seem to be against this movement, especially
during the Charlottesville Riots in mid-August of 2017. I thought it'd be interesting to see how
the IRA trolls responded to these events and their mentions of the movement.

The following plot depicts the number of mentions of "Black Lives Matter" and #BlackLivesMatter
from the time frame starting with Trump's intial announcement of his presidential candidacy in 
mid-June of 2015 until a year after he took the office of the presidency.
