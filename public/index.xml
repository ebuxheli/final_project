      <description>Throughout the 2016 US Presidential Election, Tweets were published by trolls associated with the Internet Research Agency (IRA) - a Russian entity. The IRA is believed to have been tasked with interfering in the 2016 US Presidential Election with their primary goal being to disseminate news and opinions in a way that motivated the spread of disinformation in a critical time in US politics.
